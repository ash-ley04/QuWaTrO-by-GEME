**_QuWaTrO: An Innovative Solution for Real-Time Disaster Monitoring and Climate Risk Management_**

_**DESCRIPTION/OVERVIEW**_

  In an age where climate change and natural disasters increasingly affect everyday life, QuWaTrO aims to provide an accessible digital tool that promotes environmental awareness and preparedness. It consists of four Java console-based applications—QuakeGuard, WaVer, TempTerra Knowledge Hub, and EcoPulse—each focusing on a specific environmental concern. Through interactive features and data-driven insights, QuWaTrO empowers individuals and communities to stay informed, make safer decisions, and foster sustainable behavior. QuWaTrO is a suite of four Java console-based applications designed to enhance environmental awareness, safety, and preparedness in response to natural hazards and climate-related concerns. The system consists of QuakeGuard, WaVer, TempTerra Knowledge Hub, and EcoPulse, each addressing a specific environmental issue. Through interactive features and data-driven insights, QuWaTrO aims to empower individuals and communities with accessible tools that promote sustainable, safety-conscious decision-making.


_**OOP CONCEPTS APPLIED**_

  * **Encapsulation** - Each program contains classes with private attributes and public getter/setter methods, ensuring controlled access to data and improved maintainability.

  * **Inheritance** - Common functionalities across disaster-related modules (e.g., input handling, data formatting) are implemented in a parent class and extended by specialized 
subclasses for earthquakes, waves, temperature, and ecological data.

  * **Polymorphism** - Method overriding is used to allow each module to display hazard information differently, depending on the type of environmental data processed.

  * **Abstraction** - Abstract classes and interfaces are used to define general behaviors (e.g., hazard assessment, data evaluation) while allowing each program to implement its own unique logic.


_**PROGRAM STRUCTURES**_

  * **Main.java** – Entry point of the application; allows users to access any of the four modules.

  * **QuakeGuard.java** – Provides earthquake-related data analysis and safety insights.

  * **WaVer.java** – Simulates wave-level assessments and marine safety indicators.

  * **TempTerraKnowledgeHub.java** – Offers temperature, environmental data insights, and educational content.

  * **EcoPulse.java** – Delivers ecological footprint checks and sustainability recommendations.


_**HOW TO RUN THE PROGRAM**_

**1. Starting the Program**

 * After running the program, you'll see the QuWaTrO welcome banner. You'll be presented with three options:

    * Start - Begin using the application

**2. Main Menu**

* After selecting "Start", you'll see the QuWaTrO Management Suite with these options:

    * Modules - Access the four main programs

    * Authors - View information about the developers

    * About the Project - Read about each module

    * Exit to Main Menu - Return to the start screen

    * Choose option 1 to access the modules.

**3. Selecting a Module**

* You'll now see the four available modules:

**Module 1: QuakeGuard (Earthquake Risk System)**

   * Search for earthquake risk information for locations

   * Add new locations to the database

   * View all locations

   * Filter by risk level (Low/Moderate/High)

   * Get preparedness tips

**Module 2: WaVer (Water Usage Tracker)**

   * Log daily water usage

   * View usage summary

   * Check for high usage days

   * View water-saving tips

**Module 3: TempTerra Knowledge Hub**

* Calculate the heat index from temperature and humidity

   * View saved logs

   * Delete entries

   * Learn climate facts

**Module 4: EcoPulse Climate Monitor**

   * Input climate data (temperature, rainfall, humidity)

   * View current climate data

   * Check alerts for extreme conditions

   * View logs and history

**4. Using QuakeGuard Example**

Select QuakeGuard from the modules menu

You'll see QuakeGuard's colorful welcome screen

* Choose from these options:

  1. Search Location Info → Enter a location name to see its earthquake risk details

  2. Add New Location → Add a new city/province with its seismic data

  3. View All Locations → See all locations alphabetically

  4. Filter by Risk Level → View only High, Moderate, or Low-risk areas

  5. Back to Modules → Return to module selection

* When you search for a location, you'll see:

   * Location name and type

   * Risk level

   * Number of historical earthquakes

   * Last major magnitude

   * Distance to fault line

   * Preparedness tips based on risk level

**6. Navigating Through Menus**

   * Each module has a menu system of its own

   * Always enter the number corresponding to your choice

   * Press Enter after each selection

   * Look for "Back to..." options (usually option 5) to return.

   * Use Ctrl+C if you need to force exit the program

**7. Quitting the Initiative**

* To appropriately leave:

  * Return to the Main Menu from any module.

  * Click "Exit to Main Menu."

  * The Start/Help/Exit screen will appear again.

  * Choose 3. To end the program, exit.

  * A farewell message will appear before the program ends.

_**ACKNOWLEDGEMENT**_

  We, **Gelliel Dalisay**, **Edz Margaret Untiveros**, **Mikko Ronce Labitan**, and **Elyzah Kim Diaz** _**(GEME)**_, would like to express our deepest gratitude to everyone who supported us throughout the completion of our project, _**QuWaTrO**_. This endeavor would not have been possible without the collective guidance, encouragement, and assistance we received from the people around us.

  First and foremost, we extend our heartfelt appreciation to our professor, **Mr. Juriel Comia**, whose expertise, patience, and unwavering guidance were invaluable in developing this project. Your dedication to teaching and your commitment to our learning have greatly enhanced our understanding and motivated us to deliver our best work. Thank you for providing us with the knowledge, direction, and inspiration that helped shape QuWaTrO into its final form.

  We also express our profound gratitude to each of our families, who have been our constant source of strength and motivation. Their understanding, encouragement, and support—whether emotional, moral, or through the provision of necessary resources—played an essential role in helping us stay focused and determined throughout this journey. This achievement is as much theirs as it is ours.

  To each member of our group, we extend our sincere thanks for the dedication, cooperation, and commitment demonstrated throughout the project. The teamwork, respect, and shared sense of responsibility among us made the creation of QuWaTrO not only possible but meaningful and fulfilling.

  With deep appreciation, we thank all who contributed to the success of QuWaTrO. Your support has made this accomplishment truly memorable.


_**FUTURE ENHANCEMENT**_

   QuWaTrO aims to expand its capabilities as a comprehensive environmental monitoring tool. These upgrades may include integrating real-time data from reliable APIs to give live earthquake updates, weather conditions, and climate alerts, as well as transforming the system into a GUI-based or mobile application for a more user-friendly experience.  Smoother data administration across all modules will be possible with the implementation of a centralized database, and information can be made easier to understand by incorporating visual components like graphs, charts, and interactive maps.  Future iterations might also include machine learning-based predictive features, language support, customized user profiles, and improved offline capability.  In the long run, QuWaTrO may extend to incorporate community-based reporting, automated emergency notifications, and exportable information to help larger disaster preparedness and environmental awareness.
